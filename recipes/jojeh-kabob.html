        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium onion, sliced thin</li>
            <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅓ teaspoon crushed saffron</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>metal skewers</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine onion, lime juice, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and saffron in a large glass bowl. Mix in olive oil. Press chicken into the bowl lightly and cover with plastic wrap. Let marinate for 6 hours to overnight, mixing every few hours to make sure chicken is coated.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the bowl, shake off excess marinade, and discard marinade left in the bowl. Place chicken onto metal skewers, making sure it's not too tightly packed.</li>
            <li>Cook skewers on the preheated grill until chicken is browned and no longer pink in the center, turning as needed, 10 to 15 minutes total.</li>
        </ol>
